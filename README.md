# Completionist

A little iOS app I started developing for myself and others who have the compulsion to fill completion bars. This app is for tracking and motivating your progress on recurring (weekly) goals. Your goals can be whatever you desire, but Completionist is here to keep reminding you to spend at least a little time working towards your goals every week.
